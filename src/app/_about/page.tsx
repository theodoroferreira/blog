        About me

      <article>
        <p>
          I was born in São Paulo and moved to{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian%C3%B3polis">
            Florianópolis
          </a>{" "}
          as a 10 year old kid. I fell in love with the nature, sport and music
          culture of the Magical Island.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next decade, I{" "}
          <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4ymHKBTThfeOL114lwCWPQ?si=c30897c35e404259">
            became a singer-songwriter
          </a>
          , got a Karate blue belt, won back-to-back Carnavals with a samba
          school and wasted thousands of hours playing League of Legends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I studied Economics at{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_Santa_Catarina">
            Federal University of Santa Catarina
          </a>
          , mostly for my love for History and Math. I learned a lot of
          Politics, Statistics and Macroeconomics.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I&apos;d spent too long studying models that weren&apos;t
          applicable in real-life. I felt disconnected from my studies which led
          to me dropping out after 2 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then came my first contact with programming: as a Data Analyst at a
          Tech startup. We used Microsoft Excel and Power BI to generate our
          reports.
        </p>
        <p>
          With millions of data entries, it wasn&apos;t long until my Dell
          notebook became unusably slow. This led me to learn Python and Pandas
          to better deal with datasets, as well as Selenium and pyautogui.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;ve always been obsessed with user interfaces. My friends
          couldn&apos;t bear me pointing out broken buttons and ugly websites
          all the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I found out what HTML was, I did a deep dive into the Frontend. I
          completed FreeCodeCamp&apos;s{" "}
          <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/">
            Responsive Web Design
          </a>{" "}
          and swiftly progressed to Javascript and React soon after.
        </p>
        <p>
          I became more active within the Brazilian Dev community, sharing
          quirky UI bugs and building my projects in public such as{" "}
          <a href="https://phived.com">phived</a> and{" "}
          <a href="https://css2wind.com">css2wind</a>. I collaborated with
          hundreds of developers and contributed a lot to Open Source.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2024, I traveled to Torino, Italy to visit my dad. My life flipped
          upside down and I ended up living in Málaga for a while. After I{" "}
          <a href="/articles/how-not-to-get-a-job-in-spain">
            failed to get a job
          </a>
          , I moved to the UK and landed a job in London, where I currently
          live.
